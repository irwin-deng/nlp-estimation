## Transfer learning experiment
- finetune_bert_mnli.ipynb: fine tune a BERT model on the MNLI dataset and then saves the model
- test_mnli_snli.ipynb: test the fine-tuned model on the SNLI dataset
- test_bert_snli.ipynb: test the base BERT model on the SNLI dataset

## Bayesian bootstrapping experiment
- bootstrap.py: Contains code for bayesian bootstrapping
- similarity.py: Contains functions for determining similarity between samples
- bert_model.py: Contains the BERT classifier model that we are fine-tuning
